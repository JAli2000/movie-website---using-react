just a simple practice with react hooks and fetching data from API --> "http://www.omdbapi.com"

first use `npx create-react-app YOUR-APP-NAME` in your terminal
this command will generate all the needed files and folders for a React application

**After the procces finished**, remove the files in `src` directory and replace them with files in this repository
